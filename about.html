            <h3>The Storm ID Front-end Developer Exercise</h3>
            <p>This exercise is designed to allow you to show us your Front-end knowledge and experience within a real world example.</p>

            <strong>Introduction</strong>
            <p>Your task is to create a single page app using whatever libraries you wish. The app should:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Pull data from the JSONPlaceholder (<a href="http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com">http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/</a>) API</li>
                <li>Display what is returned</li>
                <li>Include some basic interaction</li>
                <li>Include a form to POST back to the API</li>
                <li>Be responsive</li>
                <li>Support IE9+</li>
            </ul>
            <em>Optional nice to haves</em>
            <ul>
                <li>Have a nice UI</li>
                <li>Have error handling</li>
                <li>Use test frameworks</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            
            <p>Consider commenting your code explaining why your have take a particular approach. A README.md file is a good idea.</p>
            <strong>What we are looking for</strong>
            <p>We want to see how you make decisions and solve problems. Itâ€™s important that you are confident and can back up your coding decisions. The libraries, tools and approaches you chose will be used as discussion points during an interview.</p>
            <strong>How to submit your work</strong>
            <p>Create a repository on Github and share the link with us. Remember to include a README.md with any instructions on how to run your app</p>
            <em>We look forward to seeing what you come up with!</em>
